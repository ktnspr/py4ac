    "- is *interpreted*\n",
    "- is *dynamically typed* (as opposed to statically typed)\n",
    "- is *automatically memory-managed*\n",
    "- supports *procedural*, *object-oriented*, *imperative*, and *functional* programming paradigms\n",
    "- was (mostly) developed by a single person: [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/) (also known as the \"benevolent dictator\"), and therefore has a quite *opinionated* design\n",
    "- has a single reference implementation (CPython)\n",
    "- Version 3 (the latest version) is *not backward compatible* with Version 2, although the latter is still widely used\n",
    "- has an interesting programming philosophy: \"There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.\" (a.k.a. the \"Pythonic\" way) — see [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)\n",
