    "In this notebook, we will cover:\n",
    "- Object-oriented programming\n",
    "    - Creating objects\n",
    "    - Attributes and functions of objects \n",
    "    - Inheritance of objects   \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been programming procedurally; now we want to program in an object-oriented way. An object is an instance of a class. A **class** is a template or blueprint for objects. It defines what attributes (data) and methods (functions) an object will have. Once we have defined a class, we can create as many objects of that class as we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of classes somewhat like [Plato's Ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms). In the class, we describe the properties (*attributes*) that all objects of this class will have and specify what can be done with the objects (through the *methods*).\n",

    "## Task: Create Class `InsuredPerson`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class `InsuredPerson` that serves to store and display basic information about an insured individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The class `InsuredPerson` should have the following attributes:\n",
    "   - `name`: The name of the insured person (e.g., \"Anna Müller\")\n",
    "   - `date_of_birth`: The date of birth of the insured person (e.g., \"01.01.1980\")\n",
    "   - `address`: The address of the insured person (e.g., \"Musterstraße 1, 12345 Musterstadt\")\n",
    "   - `insurance_number`: A unique insurance number (e.g., \"VN123456\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The class should have a **constructor** (`__init__`) that assigns these attributes when creating an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The class should have a method `show_contract_details()` that outputs the information about the insured person in a clear format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an object of the class `InsuredPerson` with the data of an insured individual, calling the method `show_contract_details()` should produce the following output:\n",

    "## Introduction to Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "With object-oriented programming, we can already modularize and make large parts of our code reusable by working with classes and objects. By encapsulating properties and behaviors in a class, we can avoid redundant code fragments and improve maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "But object-oriented programming offers even more: **Inheritance** is a central concept that allows us to link classes together and establish relationships between them. With inheritance, we can define a general class from which specialized classes can be derived. This not only reduces effort but also creates a clearer structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability:** Common functionalities only need to be defined once in a base class. The derived classes automatically inherit this functionality.\n",
    "- **Extensibility:** New specialized classes can be easily created by inheriting from an existing class and adding additional functions or attributes as needed.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** A clearly structured inheritance hierarchy makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Inheritance with Policyholders\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine we want to manage not only policyholders in our system but also other types of individuals, such as brokers or agents. All have common attributes (e.g., name, date of birth, address), but also specific differences. Instead of redefining these properties and methods in each class, we can create a general class `Person` from which all the more specialized classes inherit.\n",

    "## Special Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen that there are special methods for classes in Python. In principle, every class should implement the following standard methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "__init__() -> Constructor\n",
    "__repr__() -> a (technical) string representation of the object\n",
    "__str__() -> a (human-friendly) string representation of the object\n",
    "__eq__() -> allows two objects of the class to be checked for equality with \"==\"\n",
    "__hash__() -> returns a unique hash value for each instance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other standard methods (which do not make sense for people) are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "__add__() -> add/concatenate two objects with \"+\"\n",
    "__subtract__() -> subtract two objects with \"-\"\n",
    "__getitem__(idx) -> index access returns the value at idx\n",
    "__setitem__(idx, value) -> sets the element at index idx to the value value\n",
    "__len__() -> returns the length of the object\n",
    "__del__() -> deletes the instance of the object\n",
