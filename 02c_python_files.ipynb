    "In this notebook, we will cover:\n",
    "- File operations\n",

    "# File Operations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can easily work with files, whether for reading data or writing information. Working with files involves three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opening** the file: We can open a file using the `open()` function to read or write.\n",
    "2. **Reading or Writing**: Once the file is opened, we can perform the desired operations.\n",
    "3. **Closing** the file: After the operations are completed, the file is closed to free up resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic File Operations:\n",
    "- **Reading a file**: We can read the contents of a file using `read()` or `readline()`.\n",
    "- **Writing to a file**: We can write text to a file using `write()`.\n",
    "- **Handling file paths**: Absolute and relative paths can be used to save or open files in different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Reading a File\n",
    "In this example, the contents of a text file are read in their entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Opening a file in read mode ('r')\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()  # Read the entire content\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```"
